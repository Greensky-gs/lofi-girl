## Installation

If you want to use it in a personnal usage, first download yarn (if you don't have, run `npm i -g yarn`)

Then you need to install the dependencies : `yarn install`

See [`./env.example`](./.env.example) to see what the `.env` file should look like

Create a `.env` file that includes :

```env
token=Your bot's token

### Command

There's a npm script that you can use to check if the `configs.json` file contains duplicated files

Use `node run duplicates` in the command prompt to run the script.

The script will build the project and check for duplicates.

If a station is duplicated, it will throw an error.

It will be sent in the channel defined by the `panelChannel` field in [`.env`](./.env.example) file
